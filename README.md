Examples of Natural Language Processing, applying machine learning to language, text and spoken

## In this repository we will conside the Bag of Words model. We will:
+ Clean text and prepare it for machine learning for Natural Language Processing
+ Apply machine learning models to the Bag of Words model

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the application of machine learning models to language. This field aims to teach machines to understand language inputs, such as dictation and writings, and draw conclusions from them. Is a comment nice pr mean? Can we categorize peer reviewed articles?
